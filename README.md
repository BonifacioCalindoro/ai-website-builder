## How to Use

### Generating a Website

1. Type your website description in the input field at the top of the screen
2. Click "Generate" or press Enter
3. Watch as your website appears in the preview window below

Example prompts:
- "Create a landing page for a coffee shop with a dark theme"
- "Make a personal portfolio with three sections: About, Projects, and Contact"
- "Build a simple blog homepage with recent posts"

You can continue editing the website by clicking "Generate" with a new prompt.

### Using Version History

1. Click the "Chat History" dropdown in the prompt panel
2. View your previous prompts with timestamps
3. Click "Restore" next to any version to revert to that design
4. The active version is highlighted in blue

### Interface Controls

- **Drag & Drop**: Click and drag the prompt panel header to move it around the screen
- **Minimize**: Click the "-" button to collapse the prompt panel
- **Copy HTML**: Click the "Copy HTML" button in the bottom-right to copy the generated code
- **Preview**: The preview updates automatically with each generation or restoration

### Tips

1. Be specific in your descriptions for better results
